Tools and tips for configuring Windows on a Mac (through bootcamp)

## Tools

* [randyrants/sharpkeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys). It lets you remap keys in Windows, e.g. swap CTRL and WIN.
    * You can also use Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator for remapping keys. However it's little bit outdated(requires .Net 2.0), and does't work well on Windows 10.
    * How to enable .Net 2.0 on Windows 10? Open "Control Panel", go to "Uninstall a Programs" then on the left panel, click "Turn Windows features on or off"; in the popup dialog, tick the .Net 2.0 related feature.

## Tips

*Fn keys as Fn keys*

If you want Fn keys just be Fn keys, (e.g. F1,F2,F3, etc.) instead of using them for controlling the display light or sound, do the following:

* Click on the bootcamp icon in the system tray
* On the popup window, switch to "Keyboard" tab
* Make sure the option "Use all F1, F2, etc. ..." is checked.
